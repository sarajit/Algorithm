/**
 * Ice Cream Parlor
 *
 * Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, they pool together m dollars for ice cream.
 * On any given day, the parlor offers a line of n flavors. Each flavor, i, is numbered sequentially with a unique
 * ID number from 1 to n and has a cost, ci, associated with it.
 *
 * Given the value of m and the cost of each flavor for t trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose
 * two flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money (m) during each visit. For each trip to the parlor,
 * print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream that Sunny and Johnny purchase as two space-separated integers
 * on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the larger ID second.
 *
 * Example :
 *          4
 *          1 4 5 3 2
 * Output : 1 4
 *          The first time, they pool together m = 4 dollars.
 *          There are five flavors available that day and flavors 1 and 4 have a total cost of 1 + 3 = 4.
 *          Thus, we print 1 4 on a new line.
 *
 *          4
 *          2 2 4 3
 * Output : 1 2
 *          The second time, they pool together m = 4 dollars.
 *          There are four flavors available that day and flavors 1 and 2 have a total cost of 2 + 2 = 4.
 *          Thus, we print 1 2 on a new line.
